# CASA0014_ethan_plant_monitor

## Overview
This repository contains the arduino code for Ethan's plant monitor for the CASA0014 module. It builds upon the standard workshop materials (as seen in this repository: https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/casa0014/tree/main/plantMonitor#overview), with a few improvements and customizations.

The goal was to build an IoT device capable of sensing soil moisture, air humidity and temperature of a potted plant and store historic data over a period of time in a timeseries database, as well as express and communicate this data in a novel and engaging way.
